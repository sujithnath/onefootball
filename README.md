## Task
https://onefootball.vercel.app/

## Setup
- yarn install
- yarn dev (to run dev)
- yarn test (to run test)
- yarn build (to run build)

## Features that I have done

- [X] Render a search form with an input field. The input field should be used to
search the players by id.
- [X] The archive should display only players with the active field set to true.
- [X] Write a test suite to make sure different item types can be handled
  - Covered with three different scenes (Fabio, giorgio, francesco)
- I have moved the API call for player to their respective components, so that
  the APP remains clean
- I have note used either Redux or context since there were no deep level
  nesting with sharing state.
- Deployed in verce


## Things I could have done

- Improve rendering performance
- Use Next.JS along with Node (Just for show my skills)
